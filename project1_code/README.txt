CS294-26 Project 1 : Color Compositing
by Rachel Albert
Project 1 loads a set of R, G, and B filtered images 
and aligns and composites them into a single color image
with excess border regions cropped.

To run this code, you will need scikit-image, a python library for image processing.
You can find more information about scikit-image at:
http://scikit-image.org/

You will also need the numpy library, but that should be pretty obvious I think.

In the CLI, run the command:
python main.py
